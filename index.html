        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. Hello, My name is Erick and I am attending California State University of Long Beach. This is my first year attending Long Beach State, which is soon to be completed. I am a part of the College of Engineering here at Long Beach State as a pre-major in computer science as a full time student. I chose this major because of the computer classes I took throughout middle school, along with conducting research online.</p>
        
</p>One thing about me is that I have two sisters; one of my sisters will be attending Long Beach State this upcoming fall, and my other sister is currently in middle school. Out the three of us, I am the eldest in the family. In addition, our family has two dog: Marley a chihuahua/terrier mix, and Astro a pomeranian, we have had them for about two - two and half years. A hobby that I have is playing video games, I've been around some type of a console ever since I was little and enjoyed playing it ever since. I enjoy being able to play and create funny moments with my friends. Another thing I like to do is listen to music, My favorte artist at the moment is Travis Scott. Another Hobby that I have picked up again over quarantine is fishing, I usually go fishing at the pier at night with my friends.</p>
